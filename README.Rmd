# About URooTab

URooTab is an R package that can conducts `EViews` unit root tests and report them in tabular form.

# Why URooTab?

While there are R packages and EViews add-ins available for presenting unit root tests in tabular form, none of them incorporates **EViews** procedures within the R environment. Specifically:

* I wish I could conduct unit root using EViews routines in R, R Markdown or Quarto document

* I wish I could dynamically import the results of the unit root tests individually or at once into R, R Markdown or Quarto document without switching between these applications back and forth.

* I wish I could use an  R function to report unit root test in a table style suitable for publication.

* I wish I could automatically format the table in `Latex`, `html`, `pandoc` and `markdown`.

* I wish I could do all of the above from R, R Markdown or Quarto without opening the EViews!!!

# Installation

URooTab can be installed using the following commands in R.

```{r installation,eval=F}
install.packages("URooTab") 

            OR
            
devtools::install_github('sagirumati/URooTab')
```

# Setup

To run the package successfully, you need to do one of the following

* Add EViews installation folder to path (**Environment Variables**).

* Don't do anything if the name of EViews executable is one of the following: `EViews13_x64`,  `EViews13_x86`, `EViews12_x64`, `EViews12_x86`, `EViews11_x64`,  `EViews11_x86`, `EViews10_x64`,  `EViews10_x86`, `EViews9_x64`, `EViews9_x86`, `EViews10`. The package will find the executable automatically.

* Rename the Eviews executable to `eviews` or one of the names above.

* Alternatively, you can use `set_eviews_path()` function to set the path the EViews executable as follows:

```{r eval=F}

library(EviewR)
set_eviews_path("C:/Program Files (x86)/EViews 10/EViews10.exe")

```



# Usage

Please load the URooTab package as follows:

    ```{r}                                                                .
    library(URooTab)
    ```

# Ways to use URooTab

The package can work with base R, R Markdown or Quarto document.

## URooTab along with R Markdown or Quarto document

You can use `URooTab` in an R chunk in R Markdown or Quarto document


```{r}
#| label: URooTab
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| output: asis
#| results: asis
    
library(URooTab)

x=rnorm(100)
y=cumsum(x)
z=cumsum(y)

dataFrame=data.frame(x,y,z)
uroot(dataFrame,format = "markdown", caption = "Unit Root Tests for x, y and Z")
```



```{r}
#| label: adf
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
    
adf(dataFrame,format = "markdown",caption = "ADF Unit Root Tests for x, y and Z")
```


```{r}
#| label: pp
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
    
pp(dataFrame,format = "markdown",caption = "PP Unit Root Tests for x, y and Z")
```
