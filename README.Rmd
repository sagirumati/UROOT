# About URooTab

URooTab is an R package that can run EViews program in R. It also adds `eviews` as a knit-engine to `knitr` package, so that users can embed EViews codes in  R Markdown and Quarto document.

# Why URooTab?

While the ecosystem of R is great, it cannot run EViews codes, not talk of handling EViews objects dynamically and reproducibly. Even though, EViews can communicate with R, users still need to switch to type-setting application to embed the EViews outputs. Specifically:

* I wish I could embed EViews codes in R Markdown or Quarto document

* I wish I could dynamically import the EViews outputs (graphs, tables, equation and series) individually or at once into R, R Markdown or Quarto document without switching between these applications back and forth.

* I wish I could use an R function in R, R Markdown or Quarto to:
  
    * graph EViews series objects.

    * graph an R dataframe using EViews.

    * import data from external sources such as `csv`, `xlsx` as a new EViews workfile or into an existing workfile.

    * create an EViews workfile from an R dataframe

    * save an EViews workfile page as a workfile or another file format.

    * execute EViews codes.

    * export an R dataframe as a new EViews workfile or to an existing EViews workfile.

    * save an EViews workfile as a workfile or another file format.
  
    * import EViews table object as `kable`.
  
    * import EViews series objects as a dataframe or `xts` object
  
    * import equation data members such as coefficients, standard errors, $R^2$ and so on.
  
    * import EViews graph objects
  
    * import equation data members, graph, series and table objects all at once.

    * simulate a random walk process using EViews.

* I wish I could do all of the above without opening the EViews!!!

# Installation

URooTab can be installed using the following commands in R.

```{r installation,eval=F}
install.packages("URooTab") 

            OR
            
devtools::install_github('sagirumati/URooTab')
```

# Setup

To run the package successfully, you need to do one of the following

* Don't do anything if the name of EViews executable is one of the following: `EViews13_x64`,  `EViews13_x86`, `EViews12_x64`, `EViews12_x86`, `EViews11_x64`,  `EViews11_x86`, `EViews10_x64`,  `EViews10_x86`, `EViews9_x64`, `EViews9_x86`, `EViews10`. The package will find the executable automatically.

* Rename the Eviews executable to `eviews` or one of the names above.

* Alternatively, you can use `set_eviews_path()` function to set the path the EViews executable as follows:

```{r eval=F}
set_eviews_path("C:/Program Files (x86)/EViews 10/EViews10.exe")

```



# Usage

Please load the URooTab package as follows:

    ```{r}                                                                .
    library(URooTab)
    ```

# Ways to use URooTab

The package can work with base R, R Markdown or Quarto document.

## URooTab along with R Markdown or Quarto document

After loading the package, a chunk for Eviews can be created by supplying `eviews` as the engine name in R Markdown or Quarto document as shown below :


```{r}
#| label: URooTab
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| results: asis
    
library(URooTab)

x=rnorm(100)
y=cumsum(x)

dataFrame=data.frame(x,y)
URooTab(dataFrame,format = "pandoc",caption = "sagiru mati",row.names=letters[1:2])
```



```{r}
#| label: adf
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
    
adf(dataFrame,caption = "ADF test")
```


```{r}
#| label: pp
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
    
pp(dataFrame,caption = "PP test")
```
