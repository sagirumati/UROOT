# 2 About UROOT

UROOT is an R package that can run EViews program in R. It also adds
`eviews` as a knit-engine to `knitr` package, so that users can embed
EViews codes in R Markdown and Quarto document.

# 3 Why UROOT?

While the ecosystem of R is great, it cannot run EViews codes, not talk
of handling EViews objects dynamically and reproducibly. Even though,
EViews can communicate with R, users still need to switch to
type-setting application to embed the EViews outputs. Specifically:

-   I wish I could embed EViews codes in R Markdown or Quarto document

-   I wish I could dynamically import the EViews outputs (graphs,
    tables, equation and series) individually or at once into R, R
    Markdown or Quarto document without switching between these
    applications back and forth.

-   I wish I could use an R function in R, R Markdown or Quarto to:

    -   graph EViews series objects.

    -   graph an R dataframe using EViews.

    -   import data from external sources such as `csv`, `xlsx` as a new
        EViews workfile or into an existing workfile.

    -   create an EViews workfile from an R dataframe

    -   save an EViews workfile page as a workfile or another file
        format.

    -   execute EViews codes.

    -   export an R dataframe as a new EViews workfile or to an existing
        EViews workfile.

    -   save an EViews workfile as a workfile or another file format.

    -   import EViews table object as `kable`.

    -   import EViews series objects as a dataframe or `xts` object

    -   import equation data members such as coefficients, standard
        errors, *R*<sup>2</sup> and so on.

    -   import EViews graph objects

    -   import equation data members, graph, series and table objects
        all at once.

    -   simulate a random walk process using EViews.

-   I wish I could do all of the above without opening the EViews!!!

# 4 Installation

UROOT can be installed using the following commands in R.

    install.packages("UROOT")
    OR
    devtools::install_github("sagirumati/UROOT")

# 5 Setup

To run the package successfully, you need to do one of the following

-   Donâ€™t do anything if the name of EViews executable is one of the
    following: `EViews13_x64`, `EViews13_x86`, `EViews12_x64`,
    `EViews12_x86`, `EViews11_x64`, `EViews11_x86`, `EViews10_x64`,
    `EViews10_x86`, `EViews9_x64`, `EViews9_x86`, `EViews10`. The
    package will find the executable automatically.

-   Rename the Eviews executable to `eviews` or one of the names above.

-   Alternatively, you can use `set_eviews_path()` function to set the
    path the EViews executable as follows:

<!-- -->

    set_eviews_path("C:/Program Files (x86)/EViews 10/EViews10.exe")

# 6 Usage

Please load the UROOT package as follows:

    ```{r}                                                                .
    library(UROOT)
    ```

# 7 Ways to use UROOT

The package can work with base R, R Markdown or Quarto document.

## 7.1 UROOT along with R Markdown or Quarto document

After loading the package, a chunk for Eviews can be created by
supplying `eviews` as the engine name in R Markdown or Quarto document
as shown below :
